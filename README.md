# chathurBot

## Chathur Bot is a computer program which act as a conversational agent to simulate intelligent conversation with one or more users in natural language.

The functionalities of chathurbot are:<br>
        1. Extract the intents(purpose of the user query) and entities(key values in the user query) from the natural language.<br>
        2. Convert extracted intents and entities to SQL Query.<br>
        3. Retrieve the data from database using the generated query.<br>

Here, We are using wit.ai ( https://wit.ai/ ) which is an exising Natural Language Processing tool to extract
intents and entities.

For initial phase, we use database which has details of different brands of phones in different online stores and it's
specification.

Further improvement on converting natural language to SQL have to be done on this project during next iteration.
